I'm "condictionally accepted" to the SAoC, this is my intended work folder to share and get comments on things.

Currently I need to make 4 months of work of promises, which oh dear planning 4 months in advance thats not my fortae. If you see something in the ulitity files that you would want something better added to the std, I would consider adding it to my todo list. Or anything else interesting "data oriented" templating that could be justifably in the std.

So open questions I have currently, who is functionally/politically in charge of std.containers?, I should probaly get thier opinion early(to correct it as much as possible).

And how many high quality data structure per dollar does the dev team/symmerity expect?

For project goals I'm already working in D to explore **data oriented** design possiblitys if your not held back by c and its 40 year old decisions. So mostly staticly sized data that has clever, well packed, cashe friendly systems. I'd like to get the simplest and general ones of these into the std, as thats just where repeative work belongs.

High quality code should be robust, have a "pit of success" api, be 99% as fast as whats possible(as opposed to the industery average of .001%).

So roughly:

1. Code I submit to the std should probaly have (mostly) complient range based iteration
2. Have the api open to critized early and often.
3. Have unit testing including real world speed testing.
