1. defining behavoir by enum strings and mixin, is considered bad style and probaly not without reason should probaly be enum controlled even if its intierlly a string mixin. Probaly easier to test as well
2. I'm pretty sure some combitation of options are bugged
3. Does ring int compile down to good assembly? I should probaly check. If not make it modulo rather then if statements.
4. If I want auto consumation of elements to be an option I'll need to define that iterator
