rough milestone plans

Month 1
-----

1. Make a framework for robustness testing data structures(intended to be good)
  - indentity test
  - sorting
  - deletion and counting
2. Clean up ring array signifigently, with unit tests
3. Get "metadata" prototype working that will serve my needs  
4. Get a working prototype of opinatented list of list
  - maybe intergate it with my connected compoint lib
5. Get a seperate frame work for speed testing, racing vs cashe-naive comparisions (intented to grab numbers for documation and to be slipshod, disposable)

Month 2
------

1. Begin trying to push for getting ring array into std experimental and doubtlessly learning the "d style" the hard way. Hopefully succed.
2. Make semi-static arrays prototype paying attension to the pro-"allocator" side of the "debate"
  - it seems I'm signifigently out numbered; concessions will likely be made.
3. Get meta data and opinated list of list, cleaned up, incuding the semi-static array intergation.

Month 3
----

1. Heavily test semi-static array and list of lists when using semistatic array
2. If everything is going well get semi-static arrays, meta-data, and opinated list of lists in std.experimental if not just the std.
3. If its not going well, panic and fix whatevers on fire.

Month 4
----

1. Play it by ear. If the std was friendlier then I thought, push more data structures that I have made for myself by this point. Other wise obey the cruel demands of the offical style guide and whatever politics.
