std.nullable is taken and I highly doubt I would be allowed to fix it by ripping out the silly bits breaking badward compadiblity.

Also by its nature, its wasting 7 bits. So I plan on making a data stucture that can have a 7 bit int(or n*8-1 size data structure with some duck typing.)

So this will be one of those two options, a nullable+7bitint as this.meta with my opinions worked out on the details.
