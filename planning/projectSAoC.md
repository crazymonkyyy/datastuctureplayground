**Symmetry Autumn of Code**

My "project" prossal is that I would like to open a line of communication with someone managing the std. I'm currently writting a video game in D which involves writting several "data oriented" data stuctures. Rather then have my work sit rotting on my hard drive I believe I could submit some of these data structures to go into the std.

These of course on not std ready as is, my personal code for my personal use isn't that high quality; but they would serve as a reasonable starting point and I may prevent several headache if I take the route of improving my code to where I would submit to the std.

I'm fairly fuzzy on details for these goal posts and fairly flexable on them but a process such as this would work for me:

1. I write up a informal specification for a data structure that the std could need.

2. I clean up and make it more genretic code I have or need to write.

3. A mentor who knows how the std operates tells me if it has any chance of getting in and some feedback of the user interface.

4. I write the unit tests to make it extermely robust and make the std happy and submit it.

I've included some informal specification with my appication and some of my old ulility files.

If you need it, my legal name is Michael Boston, but I go by monkyyy nearly everywhere; including the community discord where I been quite active.

https://github.com/crazymonkyyy/monkeydata Was my attempt to make an Array of Stuctures of Arrays template, it was far to much to bite off to chew as the way I learned D. But it is how I learned D and should be good look into what I think is possible in D, and why I'm using it as opposed to C.

I've made some other small libs that I released, but a good example would be https://github.com/crazymonkyyy/range-match I'm reasonably proud of the syntax I managed to pull off there.
